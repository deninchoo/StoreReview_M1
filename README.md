# InchooStoreReview_M1

Magento extension

This task is created for the learning purpose of new employees and interns who are getting familiar with Magento. The goal is to create “Inchoo Shop Review” Magento extension. 
The extension will let customers submit review how they liked or disliked the shop. Selected reviews are displayed on the frontend.

Extension needs to have the following features:

* Logged in customer can submit store review from My Account page (“My Store Review”)
* Logged in customer can see, edit and delete his review. He can’t post second one, only one Store Review is allowed per Website.
* For html on My Account pages try using default Magento classes and element structure, most of elements are auto-styled that way. Use Magento javascript form validation if possible.
* Administrator can see all reviews (grid, newer on top)
* Administrator can see which Customer created Review
* Administrator can edit / delete review
* Administrator can create new “fake” review, not assigned to customer (with fake customer name)
* Administrator can choose which reviews are displayed on frontend
* Selected reviews are displayed on frontend (“See what customers say about us” box)
* If customer edits review displayed on frontend, it needs to be approved/selected again by Admin (feel free to suggest approach)
* Only reviews in current language (Store View) are displayed on frontend. Makes no sense to display reviews in different language.
* Administrator gets email when new review is submitted (implement as separate module) // WIP

## Additional
Implement up to two more features of your choice that you think would be usable on such extension
